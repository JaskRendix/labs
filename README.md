# Labs – Curious Experiments and Late-Night Wanderings

This isn't a portfolio. It's not polished. It's a bunch of half-wild, half-inspired prototypes born from random obsessions, historical rabbit holes, and the occasional panic about job interviews.

I woke up once at 3 am thinking about internal control matrices like some haunted version of Giordano Bruno meets Saul Goodman. That led to a script. Then another. Then a folder. The rest followed—accidentally, inevitably.

## What's In Here?

You'll find:
- messy simulations
- prototypes with conflict logic
- things inspired by forgotten empires and Enlightenment dreams
- sci-fi sketches and asteroid mining what-ifs
- surreal maps and psychogeographic experiments

It's all stitched together by whatever Marcus Aurelius, Hideo Kojima, and Jack London would say to me if they were stuck on a Discord call with Indiana Jones during a figure skating gala inside a steampunk cathedral.

## Why?

Because sometimes I chase story ideas like Jason Bourne chases car keys in Paris.
Because the Republic of Venice still whispers.
Because Barisan of Ibelin said "hold the line", and I took it literally in my Python loops.
Because Giordano Bruno once dreamed of infinite worlds, and I took that as permission to prototype one on a Sunday.
Because Jules Verne made underwater exploration sound poetic, and I've been trying to map it in SQL ever since.
Because Marcus Aurelius kept talking about going upstream, and I keep clicking "New Branch".

Also: gamified logic checks help me sleep. So do maps of imagined oceans.

## For Whom?

Maybe for:
- The kind of interviewer who asks "Why uchronia?"
- The kind of friend who replies "Quetzalcoatl was the original astronaut"
- Anyone who reads Montaigne next to a biometric anomaly dataset and thinks "this might mean something"

## What Now?

Explore. Quote Voltaire while running `candide.py`.  
Maybe one day I'll wrap one of these in a dashboard with a fake backstory about an archaeological dig that uncovered Robespierre's login metadata.

Until then, welcome to the lab.
